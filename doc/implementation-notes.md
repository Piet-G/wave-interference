The Wave Interference simulation was ported from Java in 2018.  The first 3 screens show a 2D lattice and wave
propagation, while the final screen shows the interference pattern from a slit with a given 2d shape.

The first three screens are mainly coded in js/common.

There are 3 coordinate frames:
* view coordinates
* lattice coordinates (integer), with damping regions
* model metric coordinates (such as cm), corresponding to physical measures
