# Waves Screen

This screen depicts a 2D wave on the surface of water, or the cross-section of a spherical wave for sound or light. The
user can choose between a continuous or pulse wave.  The user can control the frequency and amplitude of the wave,
and observe how it appears on the center line in a chart.  For light, the user can also observe the light collecting
on the screen on the right.  The wave speeds can be computed as wave speed = frequency * wavelength.

# Interference Screen

This screen has two point sources that can be enabled/disabled independently, and interference patterns emerge from the
overlapping waves.  The point sources are always in-phase.  The interference pattern shows constructive interference
at d*sin(theta) = m*lambda.  TODO: Does this emerge properly in the simulation? It needs to be tested.

# Slits Screen

This screen provides an incoming plane wave, and the user can control the location of the barrier and the number of
slits and the location and width of the slits.  According to the Huygens-Fresnel principle, each part of the wave
produces spherical waves, and hence the part that passes through the slit produces spherical waves.

# Diffraction Screen

TODO(diffraction): document this part
